  - Lower barrier to adoption

### **Path 2: Standalone Geological Library** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Develop:** Add orientation constraints, faults, better surfacing
- **Timeline:** 4-6 months for v1.0
- **Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Creates specialized FastRBF geomodelling library
- **Advantages:**
  - Maintains independence
  - Can optimize for geological use cases
  - Appeals to programmatic users

### **Path 3: Full Leapfrog Clone** ⭐⭐
- **Build:** Complete GUI application with all features
