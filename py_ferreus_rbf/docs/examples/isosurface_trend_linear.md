???+ example "Intrusive style isosurface example with global trend"

    ```python
    --8<-- "examples/isosurface_trend_linear.py"
    ```

    Isosurface at a signed distance value of 0 using a global trend.
    The global trend is represented by the translucent grey plane 
    (defined by dip and dip direction), with the plunge shown as the green vector
    pointing towards the strike of the plane.
